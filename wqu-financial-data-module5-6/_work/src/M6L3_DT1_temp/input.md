Geographically Weighted Regression: A Method
for Exploring Spatial Nonstationarity

Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple ‘global” model cannot
explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the
model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this
paper, a technique is developed, termed geogra hically weighted regression,
which attempts t o capture this variation b y Cali rating a multiple regression
model which allows diferent relationships to exist at diferent points in space.
This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are
discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered
which can be described generally as tests f o r spatial nonstationarity. Using
Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed f o r investigatin the null
hypothesis that the data m y be described by a global model rat er than a
non-stationa y one and also f o r testing whether individual regression coeficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a
data set f r o m the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class
and mule unemployment. The paper concludes b y discussing ways in which the
technique can be extended.

1. INTRODUCTION

One of the main objectives in spatial analysis is to identify the nature of relationships that exist between variables. Typically this is undertaken by calculating
statistics or estimating parameters with observations taken from different spatial
units across a study area. The resulting statistics or parameter estimates are
assumed to be constant across space although this might be a very questionable
assumption to make in many circumstances. It seems reasonable to assume that
there might be intrinsic differences in relationships over space or that there
might be some problem with the specification of the model from which the relationships are being measured and which manifests itself in terms of spatially

varying parameter estimates. In either case it would be useful to have a means
of describing and map ing such spatial variations as an exploratory tool for
developing a better un C erstanding
f
of the relationships being studied.
Several techniques already exist for this purpose although we argue that the
method we develop in this paper has several important advantages. Perhaps the
most well-known framework in which parameter “drift” has been measured is
that of Casetti’s expansion method (Casetti 1972; Casetti and Jones 1992). In
this framework, parameters in a global model can be made functions of geographic space so that trends in parameter variation over space can be measured
(inter alia, Fotheringham and Pitts 1995; Eldridge and Jones 1991). While this
is an important framework in which improved models can be developed, it is a
trend-fitting exercise which is of limited use in situations where parameters
exhibit complex variation over the space being studied. The method proposed here, that of geographically weighted regression (GWR), allows the
actual parameters for each location in space to be estimated and mapped as
opposed to having a trend surface fitted to them.
The method of spatial adaptive filtering (SAF) has also been proposed to
handle spatially varying relationships (Foster and Gorr 1986; Gorr and Olligschlaeger 1994). However, this approach incorporates spatial relationships in a
rather ad hoc manner and produces parameter estimates that cannot be tested
statistically so that it is of limited applicability.
Two other methods that model spatial variations in parameter estimates are
the random coefficients model (Aitken 1996) and multilevel modeling (Goldstein 1987). In both these ap roaches the parameter estimates in regression
models are assumed to be ran om variables. In multilevel modeling, the distribution of the parameter estimates is assumed to be Gaussian, while in the random coefficients model, the parameters are modeled as finite mixture distributions. In either case, by using Bayes’ theorem it is possible to obtain an estimate
of each parameter although in neither case is any spatial dependency assumed
in the parameter estimates which seems unrealistic in models of spatial phenomena. Although geographical variations of multilevel models have been applied
(Jones 1991), these rely heavily on an assumed hierarchy of spatial units. While
this may be reasonable if the hierarchical nature of the model is reflected well
in the process being modeled, in other circumstances a “distance-decay” model
of spatial association, such as GWR, may be more appropriate.

2. SPATIAL NONSTATIONARI’N IN A REGRESSION CONTEXT

A frequently used model in geographical analysis is that of simple linear
regression (inter aha, Dobson 1990, pp. 68-78). In this technique, a particular variable, the dependent variable, is modeled as a linear function of a set of
independent or predictor Variables;

where y i is the ith observation of the dependent variable, X i k is the ith observation of the lcth independent variable, the ~s are independent normally distributed
error terms with zero means, and each a k must be determined from a sample of n
observations. Usually the least squares method is used to estimate the a k s . Using
matrix notation this may be expressed as
8 = (xtx)-lxty

where the independent observations are the columns of x and the dependent
observations are the single column vector y.* The column vector ii contains the
coefficient estimates. Each of these estimates can be thought of as a “rate of
change” between one of the independent variables and the dependent variable.
For example, if y were agreed house prices, and x contained several variables
relating to attributes of the house and its surrounding environment, coefficients
could be used to estimate the change in house price for an extra square meter of
garden, an extra bedroom, or the house being located one kilometer closer to the
nearest school.
It is important to note that these rates of change are assumed to be universal. Wherever a house is located, for example, the mar inal price increase associated with an additional bedroom is fixed. However, t is may not be the case.
It might be more reasonable to assume that rates of change are determined by
local culture or local knowledge, rather than a global utility assumed for each
commodity. Returning to the example, the value added for an additional bedroom might be greater in a neighborhood populated by families with children
where extra space is likely to be viewed as highly beneficial than in a neighborhood populated by singles or elderly couples, for whom extra space might be
viewed as a negative feature.
Variations in relationships over space, such as those described above, are referred to as spatial nonstationarity. In a recent paper, Fotheringham, Charlton,
and Brunsdon (1996) provide a demonstration of the extent to which regression
parameter estimates can vary over space. In their example, a 7 x 7 window is
placed over every cell in a 50 x 38 matrix which allows placement of the window in such a way that it is completely within the region. At each placement,
the data within the window are used to calibrate a regression model so that
each cell has a set of parameter estimates associated with it. The parameter
estimates can then be mapped to show the extent of spatial variations in estimated relationships. The results show that (a) relationships can vary significantly over space and that a “global” estimate of the relationships may obscure
interesting geographical relationships and (b) that the variation over space can
be sufficiently complex that it invalidates simple trend-fitting exercises. An example of the type of parameter surface described by Fotheringham, Charlton,
and Brunsdon (1996) is shown in Figure 1 for the relationship between population density and elevation in part of northeast Scotland. The surface shows
localized parameter estimates obtained from the window regression technique
described above in which a multiple linear regression model is calibrated
using, in this case, a 7 x 7 window. The surface shows a complex surface of
parameter values ranging from -1.26 to 0.75. In some parts of the study area,
the relationship between population and density and elevation is significantly
negative and in other parts it is significantly positive. Although there are interesting “valleys” and “hills” in this parameter surface, it is clearly too complex to
be represented by a simple linear or quadratic trend. It does, however, provide
interesting insights into how this particular relationship varies over space which
can be used to explore aspects of the relationship between the two variables
that might not otherwise be investigated.
Although the methodology of Fotheringham, Charlton, and Brunsdon (1996)
which is used to generate Figure 1 serves a useful exploratory purpose, it is ad
hoc. Hence, it is the purpose of this paper to describe a formal statistical technique, which we term geographically weighted regression (GWR), that allows

3. GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION

GWR is a relatively simple technique that extends the traditional regression
framework of equation (1) by allowing local variations in rates of change so
that the coefficients in the model rather than being global estimates are specific to a location i. The regression equation is then
k=l,m

where a i k is the value of the lcth parameter at location i. Note that (1)is a special
case of (3) in which all of the functions are conStants across space. As will be
shown below, the point i at which estimates of the parameters are obtained is
completely generalizable and need not only refer to points at which data are collected. It is very easy with GWR to compute parameter estimates, for instance, for
locations that lie between data points, which makes it possible to produce detailed
maps of spatial variations in relationships.
Although the model in equation (3) appears to be a simple extension of that
in equation (I), a problem with calibrating (3) is that the unknown quantities
are in fact functions mapping geographical space onto the real line, rather
than simple scalars as in (1). In a typical data set, samples of the dependent
and independent variables are taken at a set of sample points and it is from

15384632, 1996, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x by candy Trung - Readcube (Labtiva Inc.) , Wiley Online Library on [01/10/2026].

these that the parameters must be estimated. In the traditional model, these
estimates are constant for all i but in equation (3) this is clearly not the case.
For model (3),it seems intuitively appealing to base estimates of aik on observations taken at sample points close to i. If some degree of smoothness of the
aiks is assumed, then reasonable approximations may be made by considering
the relationship between the observed variables in a region geographically
close to i.
Using a weighted least squares approach to calibrating regression models,
different emphases can be placed on different observations in generating the
estimated parameters. In ordinary least squares, the sum of the squared differences of predicted and actual yis is minimized by the coefficient estimates. In
weighted least squares a weighting factor w, is applied to each squared difference before minimizing, so that the inaccuracy of some predictions carries
more of a penalty than others. If w is the diagonal matrix of wis. then the estimated coefficients satisfy

In GWR, weighting an observation in accordance with its proximity to i would
allow an estimation of a i k to be made that meets the criterion of “closeness of
calibration points” set out above.
Note that usually in weighted regression models the values of wi are constant,
so that only one calibration has to be carried out to obtain a set of coefficient
estimates, but in this case w varies with i so that a different calibration exists
for every point in the study area. In this case, the parameter estimation formula
could be written more generally as

There are parallels between this method and that of kernel re ression and
kernel density estimation (Parzen 1962; Cleveland 1979; Clevelan and Devlin
1988; Silverman 1986; Brunsdon 1991, 1995; Wand and Jones 1995, pp. 11445). In kernel regression, y is modeled as a nonlinear function of x by weighted
regression, with weights for the ith observation depending on the proximity of x
and x, for each i with the estimator being

f

i(x) = (x~w(x)x)-’xtw(x)y.

(6)

The essential difference between the two methods is that in (6), kernel regression,
the weighting system depends on the location in “attribute space” (Openshaw
1993) of the independent variables, whereas in (5), GWR, it depends on location
in geographical space. The output from (5)is typically a set of localized parameter
estimates in x space so that highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationships
between y and x can be modeled. The typical output from (6), however, will be
a set of parameter estimates that can be mapped in geographic space to represent
nonstationarity or parameter “drift.”
3.1 Choice of Spatial Weighting Function

Until this point, it has merely been stated that w(i) is a weighting scheme
based on the proximity of i to the sampling locations around i without an

15384632, 1996, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x by candy Trung - Readcube (Labtiva Inc.) , Wiley Online Library on [01/10/2026].

explicit relationship being stated. The choice of such a relationship will be considered here. Firstly, consider the implicit weighting scheme of (2). Here
wij = 1

vi,j

(7)

where j represents a specific point in space at which data are observed and i represents any point in space for which parameters are estimated. That is, in the
global model each observation has a weight of unity. An initial step toward weighting based on locality might be to exclude from the model calibration observations
that are further than some distance d from the locality. This would be equivalent
to setting their weights to zero, giving a weighting function of

< d;

wij = 1

if

wij = 0

otherwise.

dij

(8)

The use of (8) allows for efficient computation, since for every point for
which coefficients are to be computed, only a subset (often quite small) of the
sample points need to be included in the regression model. However, the spatial weighting function in (8) suffers the problem of discontinuity. As i vanes
around the study area, the regression coefficients could change drastically as
one sample point moves into or out of the circular buffer around i and which
defines the data to be included in the calibration for location i. Although sudden changes in the parameters over space might genuinely occur, in this case
changes in their estimates would be artifacts of the arrangement of sample
points, rather than any underlying process in the phenomena under investigation. One way to combat this is to specify wij as a continuous function of &j,
the distance between i and j. In this case, it can be seen from ( 5 ) that the coefficient estimates would then vary continuously with i. One obvious choice
might be

so that if i is a point in space at which data are observed, the weighting of that
data will be unity and the weighting of other data will decrease according to a
Gaussian curve as the distance between i and j increases. In the latter case the
inclusion of data in the calibration procedure becomes “fractional.” For example,
in the calibration of a model for point i, if wij = 0.5, then data at point j contribute only half the weight in the calibration procedure as data at point i itself. For
data a long way from i the weighting w
ill fall to virtually zero, effectively excluding
these observations from the estimation of parameters for location i.
Compromises between (8) and (9) may be reached, having the computationally desirable property of excluding all data points greater than some distance
from i and also the analytically desirable property of continuity. One such example is the bisquare function defined by
wij = [l - d;/d2I2
wij = 0

otherwise.

if

dij

< d;
(10)

This excludes points outside radius d but tapers the weighting of points inside the
radius, so that wij is a continuous and once differentiable function for all points
less than d units from i.

Whatever the specific weighting function employed, the essential idea of
GWR is that for each point i there is a “bump of influence” around i corresponding to the weighting function in such a way that sampled observations
near to i have more influence in the estimation of i’s parameters than do
sampled observations farther away. The moving window methodology used to
create Figure 1 and described more fully elsewhere (Fotheringham, Charlton,
and Brunsdon 1996) employs a weighting function defined by unity if the points
i and j lie within the square whose vertices are (-d/2,-d/2), (-d/2,d/2),
(d/2,d/2) and ( 4 2 , -d/2), and zero otherwise. This is essentially a “sudden
cut-off’ kernel like ( 8 ) , but square rather than circular in shape. In hindsight
this appears a to be rather eccentric choice of kernel, although clearly in computational terms this fits the raster framework well.
3.2 Calibrating the Weighting Function

One difficulty with GWR is that the estimated parameters are, in part, functions of the weighting function or kernel selected in the method. In (8), for
example, as d becomes larger, the closer will be the model solution to that of
OLS and when d is equal to the maximum distance between points in the system, the two models will be equal. Equivalently, in (9) as B tends to zero, the
weights tend to one for all pairs of points so that the estimated parameters
become uniform and GWR becomes equivalent to OLS. Conversely, as the distance-decay becomes greater, the parameter estimates will increasingly depend
on observations in close proximity to i and hence will have increased variance.
The problem is therefore how to select an appropriate decay function in GWR.
Consider the selection of /? in (9). One possibility is to choose /3 on a least
squares criteria. If the error terms in (3) are assumed to be Gaussian, then
this also fulfills a maximum likelihood criterion. Clearly, the way to proceed
would be to minimize the quantity
i=l,n

where $(/I)
is the fitted value of yi using a distance-decay of B. In order to find
the fitted value of yi it is necessary to estimate the a i k S at each of the sample
points and then combine these with the z-values at these points. However, when
minimizing the sum of squared errors suggested above, a problem is encountered.
Suppose is made very large so that the weighting of all points except for i itself
become negligible. Then the fitted values at the sampled points will tend to the
actual values, so that the value of (11) becomes zero. This suggests that under
such an optimizing criterion the value of B tends to infinity but clearly this degenerate case is not helpful. First, the parameters of such a model are not defined in
this limiting case and second, the estimates will fluctuate wildly throughout space
in order to give locally good fitted values at each i.
A solution to this problem is a cross-validation (CV) approach suggested
for local regression by Cleveland (1979) and for kernel density estimation by
Bowman (1984). Here, a score of the form

is used where y+f(B) is the fitted value of yi with the observations for point i
omitted from the calibration process. This approach has the desirable property of
countering the wrap-around effect, since when becomes very large, the model is
calibrated only on samples near to i and not at i itself.

Plotting the CV score against the required arameter of whatever weighting
function is selected will therefore provide gui ance on selecting an appropriate
value of that parameter. If it is desired to automate this process, then the CV
score could be maximized using an optimization technique such as a Golden
Section search (Greig 1980).
3.3 Testing For Spatial Nonstationarity
Until this point, the techniques associated with GWR have been predominantly descriptive. However, two useful questions may be examined:
Does the GWR model describe the data significantly better than a global
regression model?
Does the set of aik parameters exhibit significant spatial variation?
In the first case, the geographically varying regression model as a whole is
being tested. In the second case, it is possible to test whether the rate of
change for any specific variable alters significantly across the study re on. In
order to answer either of these two questions, descriptive statistics for t e sample must be defined. In the first instance this statistic will describe the level of
globality in the model. One possible choice here is the weighting arameter
obtained by the CV procedure which can be used to assess the di erence of
the GWR model from a global model. As described above, the value of B in
the exponential function tend to zero for the global model and deviations of
the estimate of /Ifrom zero indicate the degree of difference between the local
and global models.
For the second hypothesis, it is the variability of Gk that can be used to
describe the plausibility of a constant coefficient. In general terms, this could be
is the GWR estithought of as a variance measure. For a given k suppose
mate of Uik. Then a possible estimate of variability would be the “roughness”
of a:k, defined as

where

and G is the study area. This could be estimated if a gridwise approximation to ai;,
were constructed. However, this statistic would be relatively cumbersome to compute, so an alternative is proposed here. Suppose for each of the n sample points
i the parameter estimate a; is computed. This would give n estimates of the
coefficient under study. One way to proceed would then be to compute the standard deviation of these values. This gives a sampled estimate of (13).This statistic
will be referred to as si.
There are now two types of statistic defined, one relating to each of the questions posed above. The next stage is to determine their sampling distributions
under the null hypothesis that model (1)holds. Although it is proposed to consider theoretical properties of these distributions in the future, for the time
being a Monte Carlo approach will be adopted. Under the null hypothesis, any
permutation of (.i,yi) pairs among the geographical sampling points i are
equally likely to occur. Thus, the observed values of /3 or si could be compared

to these randomization distributions in order to perform a significance test.
Making use of the Monte Carlo approach, it is also the case that selecting N
random permutations of (.i,yi) pairs amongst the i and computing either j?or
si will also give a significance test when compared with the observed statistics.
When carrying out the test for j?, note that computational overheads may
be considerable. For each permutation, a CV-optimal must be found using a
golden section search. Although this method is time consuming, it is a relatively
simple task to compute each of the si statistics for each permutation once B has
been calibrated. One possible time-saving step, if it is not desired to test the
significance of p, is to optimize j? from the observed data, and using this value
carry out the remaining permutation-based estimates of si.
4. A CASE STUDY: CAR OWNERSHIP IN TYNE AND WEAR

In this section, the GWR technique will be applied to ward-level 1991 Census
data for the county of Tyne and Wear in the United Kingdom. The county is centered on the city of Newcastle and the River Tyne in northeast England. The relationships to be investigated are those between the rate of car ownership (as the
dependent variable) and two socioeconomic independent variables, the proportion of male unemployment and the proportion of households in social class I (a
U.K. census variable measuring the proportion of households headed by someone
in professional or managerial occupation and often used as a surrogate for highincome households). More detail on these variables is given in Table 1 and their
spatial distributions are mapped in Figures 2-4. The spatial distribution of the
cars per houszhold data indicate that the wards along the river Tyne, toward the
center of the region, generally have lower numbers of car per household than do
the suburban areas towards the periphery. High levels of male unemployment are
found in the central wards of Newcastle (located towards the centre of the region)
and Sunderland (located in the southeast). The distribution of the social class variable exhibits a less obvious pattern but reflects the wealthier areas to the north of
Newcastle and some of the coastal areas in the east of the region.
It is hypothesized that as the pro ortion of male unemployment in a ward
increases, car ownership rates will ecrease, ceteris paribus, and that as the
proportion of households in social class I increases, car ownership rates will
increase, ceteris paribus. These hypotheses are strongly supported by the
global OLS regression results given in Table 2 where both parameter estimates
are significantly different from zero at the 99 percent level and both have the
expected signs. The r-squared value for the model is 0.83 indicating a high
degree of fit to the data. However, what the results do not indicate is the stabil-

effects will still apply, with the influence of each ward on the estimate of aik
being reduced as the distance of the ward centroid from i increases. This also
provides a useful means of mapping the results of the analysis: if aik is estimated for each ward centroid, and that value is assigned to the relevant ward,
then a choropleth map of the variation in the coefficients may be drawn. These
coefficient values may then also be used as a basis for the significance tests
described above.
GWR models with the spatial weighting function described in (9) with various
values of B were .applied to the data described in Table 1 and in Figures 2-4.
The value of the cross-validation sum of squared errors CVSS is graphed as
a function of B in Figure 5. From this it may be seen that there is a globally
optimal value of /3 at around 0.303 which was confirmed by a Golden Section
optimization routine. At this value the CV score is roughly half that for the
global regression case of /? = 0. The weighting scheme around one of the city
center wards for the optimal /3 is illustrated in Figure 6. This pattern shows
how the data are weighted spatially for the estimation of the parameters for
that one ward. The weighting scheme is centered on each ward to estimate the
spatially varying parameter estimates.
The main output from GWR, that of the spatial variation in parameter estimates, is shown in Figures 7-9 for the intercept, social class, and unemployment parameters, respectively. The spatial variations in relationships revealed

by these distributions are interesting. For instance, the intercept terms show a
clear spatial pattern with higher values located in the northwest and southeast
parts of the region. These correspond to the less urbanized parts of the region
and suggest that, ceteris paribus, higher rates of car ownership are associated
with more rural areas. This might be related to reduced levels of public transit
in such areas and a greater inaccessibility to services. The relationship between
car ownership rates and social class shown in Figure 8 suggests that, ceteris paribus, for a given proportion of households in social class I, the rate of car ownership is higher for wards toward the coast and running in a band near the
southern edge of the region. A possible explanation is that car ownership rates
are higher in richer wards that are not particularly well served by the region’s

approximately in the center of the study area. The distribution of the unemployment parameter suggests that the relationship is less negative within the highly
urbanized core of the study area and in a band running southwest to northeast
across the southern part of the region. The cause of this is not immediately
obvious. An important use of GWR is as an exploratory tool for further investigation of questions and findings that might otherwise be missed.

Before discussing these results in further detail, it is useful to assess the significance of the spatial variations in the parameter estimates as determined by
computing the si statistics using the Monte Carlo method described above.
Results of these tests are shown in Table 3.
From this it can be seen that the only coefficient to vary significantly over
space is that associated with levels of social class I in a ward. This is also corroborated by the fact that the standard deviation of the spatially varying parameter estimates for this variable (1.66) is over five times greater than the standard
error of global parameter estimate (0.33 as shown in Table 2). One possible
interpretation of this is that although unemployed people may value access to
transport more in rural areas than in urban areas, practicality dictates that a
car may be too expensive to run, so that levels of unemployment do not affect
car ownership rates in any different way in urban and rural areas. However, for
the more affluent, ownership of one or more cars is often a viable option, but
this option is taken up more in rural areas, where public transportation provision is often lower and there is perhaps a greater need for car transportation.
Clearly, there may be other interpretations to this analysis, but GWR appears
to be a useful means of exploring the data and identifying underlying geographical patterns which could subsequently be incorporated into a formal modeling
procedure.

5. FURTHER ISSUES IN GWR

This paper contains a description of a new technique for spatial analysis, one
which has the potential to uncover a whole range of interesting questions about
the spatial instability of relationships. Here we discuss several issues that might
form the basis of future work on this topic.

5.1 Variability of Coefficient Estimates
All types of spatial analysis which produce localized and mappable outputs
are subject to edge effects and GWR is no exception. For instance, consider
the use of the “sudden cut off” kernel such as (8). For points close to the
edge of the study area, the number of sample points in a radius of d around i
will often be relatively small, since part of the sampling circle will lie outside of
the study area. As a result, calibration of the regression model for such points
will be subject to greater sampling error. Although the effect is more subtle,
similar phenomena will occur with other kernels. In these cases, the sum of
the weights will act analogously to n and this sum will vary according to the
location of each point, so that for regions close to only a few sampling points,
greater sampling error will occur. It is possible to compute the standard errors
of the coefficient estimates for the GWR model and by mapping these, some
indication of the reliability of each of the estimates may be obtained. In Figure
10, for example, the standard error is mapped for the Social Class I coefficient
for the example given above. It is interesting to note that this map shows
clearly that the standard errors are not uniform and are larger for wards in the
southern part of the study area.
The challenge for future research is in finding ways of simultaneously visualizing the coefficient estimates and their reliability measured by this standard
error.

5.2 Roving Hypothesis Tests
It is clear from the discussion in the previous subsection that, for each point,
a coefficient estimate and a standard error may be computed. Dividing the
former by the latter, a pseudo t statistic may be calculated. In ordinary least
squares regression, this may be used as the basis for a test as to whether the
coefficient differs significantly from zero. This is essentially a test for dependency between one of the independent variables and the dependent variable. In
the case of GWR there would be such a statistic for every point in the study
area. It is appealing to think that the test for dependency could be generalized. This would provide a method of determining in which areas one variable
influenced another-and in which areas it did not.
Clearly, careful thought has to be iven to this problem, particularly the pitfalls of multiple significance testing, ut it would be helpful if some means of
investigating the spatial nature of dependencies could be developed of either a
formal or informal nature.

\

5.3 Spatial Variations in Weighting Functions

In the GWR methods suggested so far, the weighting function, once calibrated, is assumed to be constant throughout the study area. However, there
may be circumstances when this is not a reasonable assumption. For example,
in economic applications, pricing structures may be dependent on local markets,
but the extent of the notion of locality may vary regionally-the geographical
extent of a London market may be spatially broader than that for Newcastle.
In such cases, a more reasonable approach to GWR might be to have a spatially
variable weighting function so that pi is estimated rather than /3. Although this
will be computationally complex, the results should be informative, not only of
the nature of relationships between attributes but also of the nature of how
locations interact with each other.
5.4 Extensions of GWR

The idea of using geographically weighted data to produce localized statistics
need not only apply to regression techniques. There are several other statistical
techniques that allow weights to be attached to each variable, and any one of
these could be modified to become geographically adaptive in the way that
regression has been with GWR. As a simple example, it is possible to calculate
the standard deviation of a set of observations with a weight attached to each
observation. A GWSD (geographically weighted standard deviation) could be
defined for a point i by applying a kernel weighting scheme around i to the
computation of the sample SD. This would give a surface spanning the study
region indicating the local variability of the variable being mapped. It would
also be feasible to produce localized spatial autocorrelation statistics in this
manner from a GWR version of Ord’s model (Ord 1975). Essentially, any
model which can be weighted, can be geographically weighted.
6. CONCLUSIONS

One possible interpretation of GWR is that it is a discrete transform-such as
a Fourier transform. A Fourier transform is often used with time series data to
obtain a view of its frequency content. However, the longer the period over
which the time series is observed, the more lower frequency components of
the time series can be observed. As a result, the number of data items in the
Fourier series grows with the size of the time series. Thus, rather than using

“data reduction” as a paradigm for data description, this is more a case of “data
rearrangement,” or data transformation. GWR may also be viewed in this way.
An initial data set having m independent variables, one dependent variable and
n observations contains (m 1)n data items. Having computed local ai values
for each coefficient and also for the intercept term at each of the n sample
points, there will still be (m 1)n data items in the transformed data set. However, having transformed the data in this way it is now possible to investigate
local trends in nonstationarity in regression models, something that would not
have been obvious from the raw data. Thus, like the Fourier Transform, it is a
data transform that may be used to look at a data set from a different viewpoint.
The technique can also be seen as a response to calls such as Fotheringham
(1992, 1994), Fotheringham and Rogerson (1993), and Openshaw (1993) for
a move away from whole-map statistics to localized statistics which are more
informative and which can be mapped. In this paper we take exception to single statistics, such as a correlation coefficient or a regression parameter being
used to describe a relationship over the entire geographical study area. Such a
value must be an average taken over all points in the area and might disguise
important spatial information on relationships between variables that vary
according to locality. It is suggested that significant advances in spatial analysis
can only be made if this inconsistency is addressed. It is hoped that GWR takes
some steps in this direction and will promote interest in more genuinely geographical approaches to the analysis of spatial data.
