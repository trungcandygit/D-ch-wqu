Abstract
Contextual pretrained language models, such
as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), have made
significant breakthrough in various NLP tasks
by training on large scale of unlabeled text
resources. Financial sector also accumulates
large amount of financial communication
text. However, there is no pretrained finance
specific language models available. In this
work, we address the need by pretraining
a financial domain specific BERT models,
FinBERT, using a large scale of financial
communication corpora.
Experiments on
three financial sentiment classification
tasks confirm the advantage of FinBERT
over generic domain BERT model. The
code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/yya518/FinBERT.
We hope this will be useful for practitioners
and researchers working on financial NLP
tasks.

1 Introduction
The growing maturity of NLP techniques and resources is drastically changing the landscape of finanical domain. Capital market practitioners and
researchers have keen interests in using NLP techniques to monitor market sentiment in real time
from online news articles or social media posts,
since sentiment can be used as a directional signal for trading purposes. Intuitively, if there is
positive information about a particular company,
we expect that company’s stock price to increase,
and vice versa. For example, Bloomberg, the financial media company, reports that trading sentiment portfolios outperform the benchmark index significantly (Cui et al., 2016). Prior financial
economics research also reports that news article
and social media sentiment could be used to predict market return and firm performance (Tetlock,
2007; Tetlock et al., 2008).

Recently, unsupervised pre-training of language
models on large corpora has significantly improved the performance of many NLP tasks. The
language models are pretained on generic corpora
such as Wikipedia. However, sentiment analysis
is a strongly domain dependent task. Financial
sector has accumulated large scale of text of financial and business communications. Therefore,
leveraging the success of unsupervised pretraining and large amount of financial text could potentially benefit wide range of financial applications.
To fill the gap, we pretrain FinBERT, a finance
domain specific BERT model on a large financial
communication corpora of 4.9 billion tokens, including corporate reports, earnings conference call
transcripts and analyst reports. We document the
financial corpora and the FinBERT pretraining details. Experiments on three financial sentiment
classification tasks shows that FinBERT outperforms the generic BERT models. Our contribution is straightforward: we compile a large scale
of text corpora that are the most representative in
financial and business communications. We pretrain and release FinBERT, a new resource demonstrated to improve performance on financial sentiment analysis.

2 Related Work
Recently, unsupervised pre-training of language models on large corpora, such as BERT
(Devlin et al., 2019), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018),
ULM-Fit (Howard and Ruder, 2018), XLNet,
and GPT (Radford et al., 2019) has significantly
improved performance on many natural language
processing tasks, from sentence classification to
question answering. Unlike traditional word embedding (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,
2014) where word is represented as a single vector
representation, these language model returns

contextualized embeddings for each word token
which can be fed into downstream tasks.
The released language models are trained on
general domain corpora such as news articles and
Wikipedia. Even though it is easy to fine tune
the language model using downstream task, it has
been shown that pre-training a language model
using large-scale domain corpora can further improve the task performance than fine-tuning the
generic language model. To this end, several
domain-specific BERT models are trained and released. BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) pretrains a
biomedical domain-specific language representation model using large-scale biomedical corpora.
Similarly, ClinicalBERT (Huang et al., 2019) applies BERT model to clinical notes for hospital
readmission prediction task, and (Alsentzer et al.,
2019) applies BERT on clinical notes and discharge summaries.
SciBERT (Beltagy et al.,
2019) trains a scientific domain-specific BERT
model using a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on
downstream scientific NLP tasks. We are the first
to pre-train and release a finance domain specific
BERT model.

3 Financial Corpora
We compile a large financial domain corpora that
are most representative in finance and business
communications.
Corporate Reports 10-K & 10-Q The most important text data in finance and business communication is corporate report. In the United States,
the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates all publicly traded companies to file annual
reports, known as Form 10-K, and quarterly reports, known as Form 10-Q. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the company’s
business and financial condition. Laws and regulations prohibit companies from making materially
false or misleading statements in the 10-Ks. The
Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs are publicly available and
can be accesses from SEC website.1
We obtain 60,490 Form 10-Ks and 142,622
Form 10-Qs of Russell 3000 firms during 1994 and
2019 from SEC website. We only include sections
that are textual components, such as Item 1 (Business) in 10-Ks, Item 1A (Risk Factors) in both 10Ks and 10-Qs and Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis) in 10-Ks.

Earnings Call Transcripts Earnings calls are
quarterly conference calls that company executives hold with investors and analysts to discuss
firm overall performance. During an earnings call,
executives such as CEOs and CFOs read forwardlooking statements and provide their information
and interpretation of their firms performance during the quarter. Analysts also have the opportunity
to request managers to clarify information. Institutional and individual investors listen to the earnings call and spot the tones of executives that portend good or bad news for the company. We obtain 136,578 earnings conference call transcripts
of 7,740 public firms between 2004 and 2019.
The earnings call transcripts are obtained from the
website Seeking Alpha2 .
Analyst Reports Analyst reports are another useful source of information for institutional and individual investors (sri International, 1987). An
analyst report typically provides several quantitative summary measures, including a stock recommendation, an earnings forecast, and sometimes
a target price. It also provides a detailed, mostly
textual analysis of the company. Institutional investors spend millions of dollars annually to purchase the full content of analyst reports to read the
written textual analysis. We obtain analyst reports
in the Investext database issued for S&P firms during the 1995-2008 period, which yields a set of
488,494 reports.
Overall Corpora Statistics The total size of all 4
corpora is approximately 4.9 billion tokens. We
present the pretraining financial corpora statistics
in Table1. As a comparison, BERT’s pre-training
corpora consists of two textual corpora with a total
of 3.3 billion tokens.

4 FinBERT Training
Vocabulary We construct FinVocab, a new WordPiece vocabulary on our financial corpora using
the SentencePiece library. We produce both cased
and uncased versions of FinVocab, with sizes of
2

28,573 and 30,873 tokens respectively. This is
very similar to the 28,996 and 30,522 token sizes
of the original BERT cased and uncased BaseVocab. The resulting overlap between between the
original BERT BaseVocab, and FinVocab is 41%
for both the cased and uncased versions.
FinBERT-Variants We use the original BERT
code 3 to train FinBERT on our financial corpora
with the same configuration as BERT-Base. Following the original BERT training, we set a maximum sentence length of 128 tokens, and train the
model until the training loss starts to converge.
We then continue training the model allowing sentence lengths up to 512 tokens. In particular, we
train four different versions of FinBERT: cased or
uncased; BaseVocab or FinVocab.
FinBERT-BaseVocab, uncased/cased: Model
is initialized from the original BERT-Base uncased/cased model, and is further pretrained on the
financial corpora for 250K iterations at a smaller
learning rate of 2e−5 , which is recommended by
BERT code.
FinBERT-FinVocab, uncased/cased: Model
is trained from scratch using a new uncased/cased
financial vocabulary FinVocab for 1M iterations.
Training The entire training is done using a
NVIDIA DGX-1 machine. The server has 4 Tesla
P100 GPUs, providing a total of 128 GB of GPU
memory. This machine enables us to train the
BERT models using a batch size of 128. We utilize Horovord framework (Sergeev and Del Balso,
2018) for multi-GPU training. Overall, the total
time taken to perform pretraining for one model
is approximately 2 days. With the release of
FinBERT, we hope financial practitioners and researchers can benefit from FinBERT model without the necessity of the significant computational
resources required to train the model.

5 Financial Sentiment Experiments
Given the importance of sentiment analysis in financial NLP tasks, we conduct experiments on financial sentiment classification datasets.
5.1

Dataset

Financial Phrase Bank is a public dataset
for financial sentiment classification (Malo et al.,
2014). The dataset contains 4,840 sentences selected from financial news. The dataset is manually labeled by 16 researchers with adequate back3

https://github.com/google-research/bert

ground knowledge on financial markets. The sentiment label is either positive, neutral or negative.
AnalystTone Dataset is a dataset to gauge
the opinions in analyst reports, which is commonly used in Accounting and Finance literature
(Huang et al., 2014). The dataset contains randomly selected 10,000 sentences from analyst reports in the Investext database. Each sentence is
manually annotated into one of three categories:
positive, negative and neutral. This classification
yields a total of 3,580 positive, 1,830 negative, and
4,590 neutral sentences in the dataset.
FiQA Dataset is an open challenge dataset for financial sentiment analysis, containing 1,111 text
sentences 4 . Given an English text sentence in the
financial domain (microblog message, news statement), the task of this challenge is to predict the
associated numeric sentiment score, ranged from 1 to 1. We convert the original regression task into
a binary classification task for consistent comparison with the above two datasets.
We randomly split each dataset into 90% training and 10% testing 10 times and report the average. Since all dataset are used for sentiment classification, we report the accuracy metrics in the
experiments.
5.2 Fine-tune Strategy
We follow the same fine-tune architecture and optimization choices used in (Devlin et al., 2019).
We use a simple linear layer, as our classification
layer, with a softmax activation function. We also
use cross-entropy loss as the loss function. Note
that an alternative is to feed the contextualized
word embeddings of each token into a deep architectures, such as Bi-LSTM, atop frozen BERT
embeddings. We choose not to use this strategy as
it has shown to perform significantly worse than
fine-tune BERT model (Beltagy et al., 2019).
5.3 Experiment Results
We compare FinBERT with original BERT-Base
model (Devlin et al., 2019), and we evaluate both
cased and uncased versions of this model. The
main results of financial sentiment analysis tasks
are present in Table 2.
FinBERT vs. BERT The results show substantial
improvement of FinBERT models over the generic
BERT models. On PhraseBank dataset, the best
model uncased FinBERT-FinVocab achieves the

accuracy of 0.872, a 4.4% improvement over uncased BERT model and 15.4% improvement over
cased BERT model. On FiQA dataset, the best
model uncased FinBERT-FinVocab achieves the
accuracy of 0.844, a 15.6% improvement over
uncased BERT model and a 29.2% improvement
over cased BERT model. Lastly, on the AnalystTone dataset, the best model uncased FinBERTFinVocab improves the uncased and cased BERT
model by 4.3% and 5.5% respectively. Overall
speaking, pretraining on financial corpora, as expected, is effective and enhances the downstream
financial sentiment classification tasks. In financial markets where capturing the accurate sentiment signal is of utmost importance, we believe
the overall FinBERT improvement demonstrates
its practical utility.
FinVocab vs. BaseVocab We assess the importance of an in-domain financial vocabulary by pretraining different FinBERT models using BaseVocab and FinVocab. For both uncased and cased
model, we see that FinBERT-FinVocab outperforms its BaseVocab counterpart. However, the
performance improvement is quite marginal on
PhraseBank and AnalystTone task. Only do we
see substantial improvement on FiQA task (0.844
vs. 0.796). Given the magnitude of improvement,
we suspect that while an in-domain vocabulary is
helpful, FinBERT benefits most from the financial
communication corpora pretraining.
Cased vs. Uncased We follow (Devlin et al.,
2019) in using both the cased model and the uncased model for all tasks. Experiments result suggest that uncased models perform better than cased
models in all tasks. This result is consistent with

prior work of Scientific domain and Biomedical
domain BERT models.
Corpus Contribution We also train different FinBERT models on three financial corpus separately.
The performance of different FinBERT models
(cased version) on different tasks are present in
Table 3. It shows that FinBERT trained on all
corpora achieves the overall best performance indicating that combining additional financial communication corpus could improve the language
model quality. Among three datasets, Analyst
Reports dataset appears to perform well in three
different tasks, even though it only has 1.1 billion word tokens. Prior research finds that corporate report such as 10-Ks and 10-Qs contains
redundant content, and that a substantial amount
of textual volume contained in 10-K reports is attributable to managerial discretion in how firms
respond to mandatory disclosure requirements
(Cazier and Pfeiffer, 2016). Does it suggest that
Analyst Reports data contains more information
content than corporate reports and earnings call
transcripts? We leave it for future research.

6 Conclusion
In this work, we pre-train a financial-task oriented
BERT model, FinBERT. The FinBERT model
is trained on a large financial corpora that are
representative of English financial communications. We show that FinBERT outperforms generic
BERT models on three financial sentiment classification tasks. With the release of FinBERT, we
hope practitioners and researchers can utilize FinBERT for a wider range of applications where the
prediction target goes beyond sentiment, such as

financial-related outcomes including stock returns,
stock volatilities, corporate fraud, etc.
